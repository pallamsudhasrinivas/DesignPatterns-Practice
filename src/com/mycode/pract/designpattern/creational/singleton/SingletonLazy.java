 *  It will create an instance if the instance is null, or else it will return the reference
 *  if the instance is already created
 *
 *  Drawback: If there are two threads, both will create the instance and check if the instance is null.
 *  Now, if both the threads identify a null instance, then theyâ€™ll create an instance by sequentially
 *  going into a synchronized block. This will result in two instances at the end.
 *
 *  To resolve the issue, you can use double-checked locking method
